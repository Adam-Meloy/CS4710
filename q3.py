# Question 3
# Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are fine)
brothers = ("alexander", "aleksander")
sisters = ("alexandria", "aleksandria")

# Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
siblings = brothers + sisters

# â€¢How many siblings do you have?
print(f"Siblings: {siblings}")

# Modify the siblings tuple and add the name of your father and mother and assign it to family_members
family_members = siblings + ("alex", "alexis")
